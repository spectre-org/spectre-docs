# Appendix

## Browser support

Spectre uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make most styles compatible with earlier browsers and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for CSS resets. Spectre is designed for modern browsers. For best compatibility, these browsers are recommended:

* Chrome LAST 4
* Edge LAST 4
* Firefox LAST 4
* Firefox Extended Support Release
* Safari LAST 4
