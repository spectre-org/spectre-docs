# Appendix

## Browser support

Spectre uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make most styles compatible with earlier browsers and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for CSS resets. Spectre is designed for modern browsers. For best compatibility, these browsers are recommended:

* Chrome <span class="label label-success text-tiny">LAST 4</span>
* Firefox <span class="label label-success text-tiny">LAST 4</span>
* Safari <span class="label label-success text-tiny">LAST 4</span>
* Opera <span class="label label-success text-tiny">LAST 4</span>

Spectre supports Internet Explorer 10+, but some HTML5 and CSS3 features are not perfectly supported by Internet Explorer.
